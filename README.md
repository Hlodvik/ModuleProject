The Website:
    I really wanted to take the extra step to actually deploy this website, so I bought a 70 cent domain from ionos (readit.space) and learned to use firebase for deployment. 
    This website is clearly based off of Reddit, I started off by examining their source code. I couldn't find a font I liked so I took the svg section in reddit's navbar and edited the first d to look like an a. I also took the svg for their logo and put it in an editor, made it a little different, then saved it as a png. Still, wanted to say I got the code for the vectors directly from reddit and edited them. 

    To use firebases storage I would have to pay money, which I didn't want to do. The first picture I uploaded to firestore was converted to base64, I'm not entirely sure why it didn't do that for the following images I wanted to upload, so I went to switch to use imgur's API. But after a day of testing, imgur was constantly telling me it was over capacity so I went to figure out how to compress the base64 strings so I could save them in firestore with out reaching my free read/write limits. I looked up javascript base64 compression and LZ-string was suggested so I went with that.
