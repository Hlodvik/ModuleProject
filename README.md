The Website:
    I really wanted to take the extra step to actually deploy this website, so I bought a 70 cent domain from ionos (readit.space) and learned to use firebase for deployment. 
    This website is clearly based off of Reddit, I started off by examining their source code. I couldn't find a font I liked so I took the svg section in reddit's navbar and edited the first d to look like an a. I also took the svg for their logo and put it in an editor, made it a little different, then saved it as a png. Still, wanted to say I got the code for the vectors directly from reddit and edited them. 

    learned about the optional chaining operator when I felt there was far too many if statements in the script.

    I put a lot of work into writing the hero section message, and I think it does a fair job at explaining the 'purpose' of the website. 
    As for gradable content:

                                                                            Navigation Bar
                                                    Add a navbar with at least 3 links (e.g., Home, About, Contact).

using bootstrap classes made this easy breezey.
